      As a security feature your session has timed out due to a period of
      inactivity. By default this is fifteen minutes, but you may have set
      it to something different.

    <p>
      As you have previously set a PIN you may enter it now to re-enable your
      session:
    </p>
    <p>
      <form method="post" action=".">
        <label for="pin">
          Enter your PIN
        </label>
        <input id="pin" name="pin" type="password"/>
        <input type="submit" name="reauthenticate" value="Submit"/>
      </form>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are unable to remember your PIN, you may reset your session by
      using the button below. Please note that all preferences will be lost,
      requiring you reauthenticate to any services you were previously using.
    </p>
{% else %}
    <p>
      In this instance there is no way to re-enable your session, however in
      future you may set a PIN for this purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The button below will clear your secure session, allowing you to
      reauthenticate with any services you were previously using.
    </p>
{% endif %}
    <p>
      <form method="post" action=".">
        <input type="submit" name="clear_session" value="Start over"/>
      </form>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may set a new PIN at any point by using the link at the bottom of an
      authenticated page.
