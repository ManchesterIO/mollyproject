=====================================

.. module :: molly.utils.middleware

A library containing middleware classes for Molly

LocationMiddleware
------------------

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add ``molly.utils.middleware.LocationMiddleware`` to your 
``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting and you're done.

Usage
^^^^^

LocationMiddleware enables location awareness in Molly. Locations can be
provided in a number of ways.

1. **Stored as a session variable** - this is the default for people
visiting the site with their browsers. Molly redirects the user to
a view that gets their location if they visit a view that requires
their location and their current session doesn't already store it.

2. **Provided as an HTTP header** - useful for third party apps
accessing Molly via API calls. The format of the HTTP header is as follows:

    ``X-Current-Location: latitude=x.xx,longitude=y.yy[,accuracy=z]``
    
For example:

    ``X-Current-Location: latitude=51.40392,longitude=1.0203``
    
    ``X-Current-Location: latitude=51.40392,longitude=1.0203,accuracy=5``

3. **Provided as HTTP query string parameters** - an alternative to
HTTP headers where it's easier to use a query string. The format is 
as follows:

    ``latitude=x.xx&longitude=y.yy[&accuracy=z]``

For example:

    ``http://mydomain.com/places/nearby/?latitude=51.40392&longiture=1.0203``

    ``http://mydomain.com/places/nearby/?latitude=51.40392&longiture=1.0203&accuracy=5``

Note: When providing location as an HTTP header or as query string parameters, 
latitude and longitude are mandatory, and will be interpreted using
the WSG84 datum. Accuracy is optional.
