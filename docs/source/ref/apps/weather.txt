:mod:`molly.apps.weather` -- Weather
====================================

.. module :: molly.apps.weather

This shows weather to users (and by default, is embedded in the home page)

Configuration
-------------

 * location_id: the code of the weather to use (use 'bbc/ID', where ID is the
   location ID for the BBC)
 * provider: the weather information source

Sample::

    Application('molly.apps.weather', 'weather', 'Weather',
        location_id = 'bbc/25',
        provider = Provider('molly.apps.weather.providers.BBCWeatherProvider',
            location_id = 25,
        ),
    ),

Providers
---------

It is recommended to use the MetOffice provider as BBC Weather is not working at the moment
and should be changed in the near future.

molly.apps.weather.providers.BBCWeatherProvider
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Uses the BBC Backstage datafeed to get weather information. The ID for the
weather location can be obtained by looking at the URLs when doing a weather
search. It has one option:

 * location_id: The BBC ID for this weather location

molly.apps.weather.providers.metoffice.MetOfficeProvider
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Uses the MetOffice DataPoint API to get weather information. This provider requires
an API key that needs a registration on `MetOffice DataPoint <http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/ddc/>`_.
This key should be inserted in API_KEYS as "metoffice".

It has two options:
 * forecasts_location_id: the ID for the location of forecasts
 * observations_location_id: the ID for the location of observations
