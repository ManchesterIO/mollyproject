AJAX and other Data Formats
===========================

Molly's approach to views lends itself to a large amount of flexibility. One
such flexibility is the ability to vary the format of the rendered view based on
the Accept headers of the client, or a manual override of the data format based
on an additional GET parameter: format.

To stop this functionality on a particular view (e.g., if the context contains
data that should not be exposed), you can set ``exposes_user_data`` to True in
the context.

The data formats supported are:

 * XML
 * JSON/JSONP
 * YAML

And in each of these, the is presented as it is in the context.
