  <div>
    <p>
      Mobile Oxford was produced as part of the
      <a href="http://erewhon.oucs.ox.ac.uk/">Erewhon Project</a>, a
      <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>-funded project to explore the
      provision of location-aware applications and adaption of Weblearn (Oxford's implementation of the Sakai VLE) for use on
      mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is designed and managed by the Erewhon Team at Oxford University Computing Services.

  <h2 style="color:#002147;">Isis and Godstow flag statuses</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Mobile Oxford updates from the Oxford University Rowing Clubs website approximately every ten minutes, and may lag behind.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the flag status applies only to the stream speed and as such must be taken as only a part of the cox,
    crew and coachâ€™s risk assessment before each outing. The flag does not mean it is necessarily safe for those unrestricted but rather
    it is deemed necessarily unsafe for those restricted.</p>
    <p>NB: over the vacation period when the flag is not being updated it will appear grey and all stream condition queries should be directed towards the EA.</p>
