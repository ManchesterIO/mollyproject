Installation
============

Depenencies
-----------

Install the following packages:
 * postgres
 * python-psycopg
 * python-beautifulsoup
 * python-simplejson
 * python-django

Database
--------

As a superuser, create the mobile_portal database and user:

 $ createdb mobile_portal

 $ createuser mobile_portal -P
 Enter password for new role: 
 Enter it again: 
 Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
 Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
 Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n

Make sure the password is the one given in settings.py

Now edit pg_hba.conf to allow passworded logins from the new user by adding the
following line somewhere near the top. Order is important, so it needs to go
above any more general access directives.

 local mobile_portal mobile_portal md5

Log in to the server and allow the user access to the database:

 $ psql mobile_portal
 Welcome to psql 8.3.7, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

 Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
        \h for help with SQL commands
        \? for help with psql commands
        \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
        \q to quit

 mobile_portal=# grant all on database mobile_portal to mobile_portal;
 GRANT
 mobile_portal=# ^D

Either send SIGHUP or restart the server to reload pg_hba.conf

Change directory to mobile_portal/mobile_portal and use manage.py to initialise the database:

 $ cd /Erewhon/mobile_portal/mobile_portal
 $ python manage.py syncdb

It should ask you to create a new superuser. Say yes and set one up.
