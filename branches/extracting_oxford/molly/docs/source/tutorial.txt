Getting started
===============

The Molly framework is designed so that the least you have to do is choose the
features you wish to expose, write some connectors, and create a base template.

We'll start with how to acquire and install the code, before moving on to 
getting the demonstration site working. After that we'll explore some basic
customisation and deployment issues.

Getting the code
----------------

Molly is distributed under an :doc:`Academic Free License v3.0 <license>` and
is maintained in a Git repository at SourceForge. Releases 0.1 and 0.2 are
specific to the University of Oxford, and work on 0.3 is ongoing. Instructions
for accessing the Git repository can be found on `the project pages
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mollyproject/develop>`_.

Current development is taking place in :file:`branches/extracting_oxford/` [#fn1]_ and the
rest of this tutorials assumes that you are working relative to this directory.

Installing the code
-------------------

We recommend the use of `pip <http://pip.openplans.org/>`_ and `virtualenv
<http://virtualenv.openplans.org/>`_ for deployment, though you may install
Molly into your :file:`site-packages` directly. We'll assume you're using
:file:`~/mollyenv` as your virtual environment.

To begin, set up your virtual environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd ~
   $ easy_install pip virtualenv
   $ virtualenv --no-site-packages mollyenv



.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#fn1] trunk/ and tags/ currently contain stable versions as used by the
          University of Oxford. In time more generic code will appear in these
          locations.
