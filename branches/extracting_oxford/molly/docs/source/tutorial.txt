Getting started
===============

The Molly framework is designed so that the least you have to do is choose the
features you wish to expose, write some connectors, and create a base template.

We'll start with how to acquire and install the code, before moving on to 
getting the demonstration site working. After that we'll explore some basic
customisation and deployment issues.

Getting the code
